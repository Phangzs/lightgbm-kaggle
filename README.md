#### Machine Learning with lightbgm model

This is sample code for a lightgbm model for a house prices prediction competition on Kaggle. 

Initially this submission made top 30%, but after many years, this submission has been pushed down to around the 50% percentile. Still, it is an interesting experiement to play around with.

While at the time it was perhaps best run on Colab or Kaggle's accelerators, it should be just fine to run on a modern laptop.
